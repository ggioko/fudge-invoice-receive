# FUDGE Invoice Receive
## Project Description
In recent times due to introduction of e-invoicing for Australian businesses, our team has created a e-invoice receiving platform called FUDGE Invoice Receive which can be used to store, send and render e-invoices in the form of UBL XML.

This SENG2021 project was created by Team FUDGE and uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python as well as Flask.
